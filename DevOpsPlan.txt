Devops Plan:
build 2 to 5 docker containers each running an independent set of tests
for providing parralel run enviornment

Using jenkins & Teraform code
Use Jenkins job1
  use teraform to build each docker os layers & instalations
Use Jenkins Job2
   git pull of last automation code version
Use Jenkind Job3
  invoke the dockers for them to be ready to start the testing
Use Jenkins Job4
  invoke all the test sets on all the dockers one after the other/or in parralel
   so they will run in parralel
 each docker will have an independant allure paramatrized job to configure and report
 the test run.
